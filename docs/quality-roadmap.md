# Quality Roadmap

## In Place

- ESLint (`@typescript-eslint` + `eslint-plugin-security`) — lint gate on pre-commit and CI
- TypeScript strict mode — structural type safety
- Husky pre-commit: lint-staged → typecheck → test:unit → audit
- Husky pre-push: full suite with coverage thresholds — catches coverage failures before CI
- GitHub Actions CI: lint → typecheck → test (with coverage) → audit
- Jest coverage thresholds: 80% lines/statements/branches/functions
- `docs/specs/` — specs as source of truth before any feature implementation
- Secretlint — scans all staged files for credential patterns on pre-commit and CI; `.env.example` excluded via `.secretlintignore`
- commitlint — enforces conventional commit format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, etc.) on `commit-msg` hook
- dependency-cruiser — static import graph rules; three forbidden boundary rules enforced at pre-commit and CI
- knip — unused files, exports, and dependencies; CI only; `src/**/*.dto.ts` treated as entry points to avoid decorator false positives

## Known Warnings (no direct fix available)

Deprecation warnings that appear on `npm ci` with no actionable fix path:

- `glob@7` (×1) + `inflight` — via `babel-plugin-istanbul` → `test-exclude`, a jest internal. Will clear when jest updates `babel-plugin-istanbul` or `test-exclude` to use a newer glob.
- `glob@10.4.5` — via `@nestjs/cli`. Will clear when `@nestjs/cli` updates its dependency tree.

`npm audit --audit-level=critical --omit=dev` is clean. These are dev-only and cosmetic.

## Known Vulnerabilities (no direct fix available)

High-severity CVEs in production dependencies with no non-breaking fix path. Audit gate lowered to `--critical` until resolved.

- **GHSA-5528-5vmv-3xc2** (`multer < 2.1.1`) — DoS via uncontrolled recursion. Fix requires `@nestjs/platform-express@11` (breaking). Tracked for next NestJS major upgrade.
- **GHSA-5v7r-6r5c-r473** / **GHSA-j47w-4g3g-c36v** (`file-type`) — infinite loop / ZIP decompression bomb via `@nestjs/common`. No direct fix; awaiting NestJS upstream resolution.

## Planned

### Stryker — mutation testing
Validates test quality, not just coverage. Makes small mutations to production code (flips `>` to `>=`, deletes a `throw`, inverts a condition) and checks whether the test suite catches them. A surviving mutation means logic exists with no test asserting it.
- Scope to start: `src/domain/` only — fast, high signal, directly tests TDD discipline on invariants
- Wire into: scheduled CI job (weekly), not every push — it is slow
- Implement after: Orders acceptance test is GREEN

### Renovate — automated dependency updates
Opens PRs automatically when dependencies have updates; CI runs against each PR. Proactive complement to `npm audit` (which is reactive — fires only after a CVE is published).
- Config: `renovate.json` at repo root
- Group strategy: patch/minor together, major separate
- Wire into: GitHub App (no local tooling needed)

### Prettier — formatting
Consistent formatting (indentation, trailing commas, line length). Eliminates formatting noise in diffs and reviews.
- Config: `.prettierrc`
- Wire into: lint-staged (format before ESLint), CI format check
- Decision needed: tabs or spaces, 80 or 120 column width
